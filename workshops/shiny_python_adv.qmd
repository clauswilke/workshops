# Description

Our Intro to Shiny for Python workshop takes you through the basics of building Shiny for Python applications with Shiny Express. This course builds on those concepts and teaches you how to build and maintain large, mission-critical applications in Shiny. After this one-day workshop you will understand how to identify problematic Shiny code, and how to build robust apps which are easy to maintain and extend.

The topics we will cover are: - What is Shiny Core and why do we use it? - Basics of Shiny modules - Communicating between modules - Testing Shiny applications with pytest and playwright

# Audience

This course is for you if you:

-   Are comfortable working with Python
-   Have built and maintained a few Shiny applications in either R or Python
-   Are comfortable with Shiny concepts like reactive calcuations and effect

This course is probably not for you if: - You aren't really comfortable with Python - You are picking up Shiny for the first time
